### Goal and Value of the Application

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes

To trigger state changes with the shopping cart, the user should click the "+" or "-" buttons for the corresponding menu items. This will also change the number displayed on the corresponding item card. Users cannot decrement the number of items in the cart below zero by clicking the "-" button, though there is no upper limit to how many items they can add to their cart by clicking the "+" button.
